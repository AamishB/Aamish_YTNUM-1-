# YouTube Mobile UI Redesign for Mindful Watching 🌸

This project redesigns YouTube’s mobile viewing experience to discourage compulsive binge-watching while preserving engagement and retention. By introducing subtle, non-intrusive interface elements like the **Session Time Blossom**🌼 and **Mindful Break Overlay** 🧘, the design promotes healthy viewing habits without disrupting the dopamine-driven flow of content consumption. Built as a Figma prototype, it leverages micro-interactions and visual cues to nudge users toward mindful breaks.

## Problem Statement ❓

Redesign YouTube’s mobile viewing experience to discourage compulsive binge-watching—but in a way that doesn’t negatively affect engagement or retention. Your design should subtly influence user behavior through interface alone (no backend logic), preserving the dopamine-driven flow of content consumption:
- Micro-interactions to encourage breaks. ⏸️
- Visual rhythm cues tied to watch patterns. 🎨
- Non-intrusive session/time reminders. ⏰
- Subconscious nudges embedded in the layout. 🧠

This prototype addresses these goals by introducing two key features: a blooming blossom icon that tracks session time and a mindful break overlay that suggests a 30-second stretch, both designed to fit seamlessly into YouTube’s aesthetic.

## Design Idea 💡

The design focuses on two primary features to promote mindful watching:

1. **Session Time Blossom** 🌷:
   - A small, elegant icon in the video player’s top-right corner that blooms after 20 minutes of continuous watching.
   - Acts as a non-intrusive session reminder, using a flower-like visual to symbolize growth and time 🌱.
   - On tap, it displays a tooltip suggesting a quick stretch, empowering users to take action without forcing a break 💪.
   - The blooming animation (over 5 minutes) serves as a subtle visual rhythm cue, encouraging users to notice their watch time subconsciously.

2. **Mindful Break Overlay** 🕉️:
   - Triggered by tapping “Take a Break” in the blossom’s tooltip, this semi-transparent overlay suggests a 30-second stretch.
   - Features a pulsing card and a progress ring that fills during the pause, creating a calming micro-interaction 🔄.
   - Users can choose to “Continue Watching” (returning to the video) or “Pause for 30s” (engaging the break), ensuring control and flexibility ✅.
   - The overlay’s design is subtle, preserving YouTube’s dark theme and engagement-driven flow.

These features align with YouTube’s brand and prioritize user agency, ensuring breaks are optional and non-disruptive.

## Design Approach 🛠️

Key principles:
- **Subtlety**: The blossom and overlay are unobtrusive, appearing only when relevant (after 20 minutes or on user interaction) 🙈.
- **Engagement Preservation**: Optional interactions (tap to view tooltip, choose to pause or continue) respect the user’s desire to keep watching 🎥.
- **Visual Cues**: The blooming blossom and pulsing overlay use animations to draw attention without overwhelming the viewer 🌟.
- **Accessibility**: High-contrast colors and screen reader labels ensure inclusivity ♿.

The prototype includes three artboards:
1. **Video Player Screen**: Displays the video, progress bar, and Session Time Blossom (empty and filled states) 📱.
2. **Video Player with Tooltip**: Shows the blossom’s tooltip with a “Take a Break” button 💬.
3. **Mindful Break Overlay**: Offers a stretch prompt with a progress ring and continue/pause options 🧘‍♀️.

## Tools Used 🧰

- **Figma**: For designing and prototyping the mobile UI (iPhone 16 Pro Max frame, 440x956px) 🎨.
- **Figma Contrast Plugin** : To verify accessibility of color choices 🌈.
